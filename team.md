Hi everyone! My name is Alex and I am very excited for this course! I graduated from UConn with a BS in Computer Science. I am currently working at MassMutual in a Site Reliability Engineering Development Program. At BU, I am pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Software Development. For this class, my project role is Configuration Leader. I plan to use my knowledge of CI/CD to ensure we use best practices for our committing/branching strategy and for our application deployments. I look forward to learning new technologies, deployment patterns, security best practices, and anything else that I can from my team members.

Hi all, I'm Eric Ashton and I'm happy to be with you! I'm a student in the Master's in Software Development online at BU. I’ve worked for the NYC Department of Education my whole career. I was a high school Earth Science teacher from 2003 through 2010. Then in 2010 I switched over to a role in the central office working on producing online school report cards. From 2013 through the present, I’ve served as Executive Director for School Performance, leading a team of 15-25 developers, designers, and data analysts in monitoring and reporting on school quality. Most of my team’s work can be found at https://tools.nycenet.edu/.  In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, my family and I moved from NYC to Rockport, Maine so I now work remotely for the NYCDOE. My programming and software development skills have been mostly self-taught over the years so I am looking forward to getting more formal knowledge through this program, course, and project.
