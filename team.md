## Alex Kolbin
I graduated from UConn with a BS in Computer Science. I am currently working at MassMutual in a Site Reliability Engineering Development Program. At BU, I am pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Software Development. For this class, my project role is Configuration Leader. I plan to use my knowledge of CI/CD to ensure we use best practices for our committing/branching strategy and for our application deployments. I look forward to learning new technologies, deployment patterns, security best practices, and anything else that I can from my team members.
