# Team 4

## Project Description
This project is a light-weighted customized recommendation system which makes accurate recommendations for the end user. The whole system is driven by the python machine learning model which is trained on the imdb movie dataset and the user preference data. Besides of that, this project has humanized user interface to ensure the convenient user-machine interactions.

## HOW TO RUN

1. Clone Repository:

$git clone https://github.com/BUMETCS673/group-project-team4.git
```
2. Set up the local Python 3.x environment in your local machine.
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```
3. Install TensorFlow 2.x with pip
```
pip install --upgrade pip

pip list  # show packages installed within the virtual environment

pip install --upgrade tensorflow

python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])))"
```
4. Set up database, backend and frontend environments
Our team used AWS RDS PostgreSQL as the database, Django framework for the backend (found in Code/django), and Angular for the frontend (found in Code/angular).
